Thinking of implementing the parent and teacher/principal feature so that these people are the ones that have access to the advanced data/report card.

Thinking of callign the learning center "Study Room"

Thinking of pivoting to normal learning app, and focusing on parents that can afford to pay for these high quality education withing Africa and beyond. This would mean focusing on 
Maths, English, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Econs, Accounting, Commerce and some others.
This would mean our learning shouldn't be overgeared to Nigerian context.

This woud mean we can have unique modules for JAMB.WAEC. NECO.
Just some slight changes.

This would mean the learning center materials must be topnotch because we would be competing with VC-backed apps like uLesson.

This would take our app from one used every quarter to everyday - that's where true scalability comes in. For every day apps, we will use the bite-sized unlocking structrue so student get access to other topics after they pass one.
But for exam mode, they take initial test and get access to practice anyone.

Later we will follow the principle of KISS for every page so that the source code is easily scalable and maintainable. Also follow Betty standard for commenting.


This is obviously not scalable. To change the name from JAMB Pro to Raven, I'm having to re-edit all the places, I initially had JAMB Pro. I learnt to use variables and MACRO coding sometime ago to avoid issues like this but it's been years. Once you start editing in more than one line, thats ineffective coding.



Code4Impact: 
Backend= Seperate logic, design and data

later on, we will add features whereby we see schools whose students are topping the leadership on a weekly basis.
we are not replacing the teachers, we are here to support.
The principals get to see a big picture view of the performance of her entire students - she sees the probability and the statistics


Range - what's the gap between the highest and the lowest. Is the gap increasing over time or is it closing? If it's increasing and then they put in measures to close it, the app gives them opportunity to see if the gap is closing. This can be done right from SS1.


this might be hard for public schools. 
we'll have package that reduces the price for them - price differentiation




Build a schema for all subjects and subtopics based on your structure so you can batch import questions.
structure works well:
Modular: Each question is part of a questions array under its subtopic.

Separation of logic: solution includes steps and final_answer to help adaptive systems parse reasoning.

Extensible: You can add tags, difficulty, image, explanation_audio, review_interval, or even ai_notes.
