To build a **granular and adaptive Physics module** for your edtech app that is **efficient even for students with weak learning ability**, we need a structure that:

1. **Breaks down each topic into manageable learning units**
2. **Groups related concepts into intuitive categories**
3. **Supports adaptive scaffolding** ‚Äì building progressively from fundamental to complex
4. **Incorporates metadata** like difficulty, prerequisites, time-to-learn, skills, and common misconceptions
5. **Allows dynamic adjustment** of pacing and review based on performance

## üí° Learning Path Recommendation Logic (for weak learners)

1. **Start with foundation topics** ‚Üí Measurement, Scalars/Vectors, Linear Motion
2. **Enforce prerequisites** before unlocking higher-level content
3. **Repeat and reinforce** with different content types (video, quiz, game, short notes)
4. **Enable practice mode with increasing difficulty**
5. **Use adaptive review intervals** (as you‚Äôve designed before)
6. **Offer error-specific feedback** ("You confused elastic and inelastic collisions")
