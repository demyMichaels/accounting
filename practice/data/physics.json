    "options": ["A: 3", "B: 1.5", "C: 1.32", "D: 1", "E: 0.67"],
    "answer": "E",
    "explanation": "Since ΔL = LαΔT and both metals have the same ΔL and ΔT, then L_copper × α_copper = L_iron × α_iron. Given α_copper/α_iron = 1.5, then L_iron/L_copper = 1.5 → L_copper/L_iron = 1/1.5 ≈ 0.67. Thus, the copper specimen must be shorter to show equal expansion."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Using α = ΔL/(L₀ΔT): Expansion ΔL = 10.26 - 10 = 0.26cm. Thus, α = 0.26/(10 × 100) = 0.00026°C⁻¹. This small value is typical for metals - they expand only slightly with temperature changes."
